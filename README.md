¡Hola! My name is Edwin Torres or Edwin Torres Hernández or Edwin Torres-Hernandez or just Edwin. I'm a father of two, a boricua (Puerto Rican), and the husband of a minister of Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.). My mother tongue is Spanish, but I learned English during my twenties. My pronouns are he/él.

## Who am I?
### Non-work
I live in the San Juan metropolitan area of Puerto Rico with my wife, son, daughter, and two guinea pigs. We started to do homeschooling after the COVID-19 pandemic when we did Kinder and Pre-K for our two kids. My wife has a degree in Education which has been essential for our success during these challenging times.

I’m a morning person; I start all my days at about 4:45 AM when I take some time to study any new interest I have, and then I do some workouts and listen to audiobooks and podcasts. My current goal is to run 5 miles in an hour or less. This time in the morning is my personal time, and it's the thing I do for my mental and physical health. 

We do the homeschooling right after breakfast, and this takes us about two hours. And then I start my day working with amazing people on [18F](#work). 

Other things I love are
* Going to the beach
* Dance salsa
* History 
* Learning new things (My queue: 11ty, Solidity, Terraform, ...)
* Investing 
* TV series (The Big Bang Theory, Game of Thrones, and Doctor Who are some)
* Movie at the cinema (Marvel, SiFi, and things like that)
* Traveling (Perú and D.C. are next on the queue)
* Taking photos of the sunrise.

Something weird I like to do is remind myself of missing opportunities, just to keep myself aware that I don’t know everything and I can't predict the future. For example not buying Apple stocks in the early 2000s, starting a blog about Windows Phone (yup, I know!), and not buying Bitcoin that time I heard about in 2011.

Fun fact, 18F is the first job I've had where English is the main language. After all, [the United States is the second-largest Spanish-speaking country in the world](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/u-s-no-2-spanish-speaking-country-world-n383921).

### Work
I’m a Software Engineer at 18F. I have over 13 years of consulting practice in different industries and verticals, including government, education, digital media, and tourism. Mostly my experience has been designing and developing web applications and data analytics solutions.

I love building data visualizations, and I feel comfortable working with both frontend and backend code. I was fortunate to have the opportunity to lead an amazing team in the design and development of a data application that currently serves the educational community of Puerto Rico.

Right before 18F, I worked as Product Manager of a Multi-tenant SaaS application to create dashboards and open data for the general public.

## Scheduling // Time zones

I’m based on the GMT-4 time zone, which I learned recently is called the Atlantic Standard Time zone (AST). We don’t have daylight saving time which means that between March to November I have the same time as Eastern Standard Time (EST). 

I start around 9:30 AM to 10:30 AM in my time zone because of homeschooling. I’m flexible to take meetings but I try to not take those after 6:00 PM AST. 

## Goals

### Learning goals
Since I started my career I’ve tried to work on a project with elements of predictive analytics. In the 2000s it was data mining, then after 2012 it became machine learning and A.I. 

I had the opportunity to work on putting into production a predictive dropout model, which uses logistic regressions to try to predict students with a high dropout risk.

My goal is to continue learning about machine learning and be able to work on more projects related to predictive analytics and artificial intelligence.

### Career goals
I’m very open to any opportunity, what I really like to do is work on projects that have a tangible impact on organizations, communities, and/or the general public. Having said that I have some organizations that I would love to work with, those include the U.S. Department of Education, NASA, TTS Solutions, and any office that works with the U.S. Territories like the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs at the White House or the Office of Insular Affairs at Department of the Interior.

## You can lean on me to …
Practice Spanish or I can talk with you about your questions related to 
* Cloud (Azure, Azure DevOps)
* Data Engineering (SQL, SQL Server, Power BI, ETLs, Data Warehouse)
* Data Visualization
* Puerto Rico or the U.S. Territories in general

## How to support me as we work together
Taking notes is not my strong suit even when I have worked successfully in user research interviews in the past. I appreciate when people give me more time when I’m taking notes or help me with this task in any other way.

## How to support me as a person
My kids are very young and still doing homeschooling so they occasionally appear on video calls (sometimes crying).  If an emergency happens with them during a call I’ll need to leave immediately.

## Ways of working together
I like to co-work but also I’ll need some time to work async so I can organize my thoughts.

## Teamwork preferences
I like to experiment and iterate. Every team is like a totally different person, so I don’t try to replicate other previous experiences. 

I feel confident in saying I don’t know and try to make everyone feel the same. We don’t know everything and that’s ok. 

## Technical preferences
JavaScript and SQL, are my preferred languages (don’t ask why). I like Windows and Android. Visual Studio Code (vscode) is my preferred IDE. I used Excel and PowerPoint a LOT!

## Feedback preferences
Receiving feedback in Slack, email, or calls works for me. I will take some async time to process the feedback and then maybe I can ask questions to clarify.

I’m better at giving feedback via text (Slack, email, emojis). I am trying to be more intentional with positive feedback.

Any feedback? Let’s have a virtual coffee.
